# Neighborhood Map: Wrocław Museums

This is the last project made for Udacity Front-End program as a part of Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

## Project Overview

Application shows the best museums in Wrocław, the city located in south-west area of Poland.
The user can search for museum, click on the list and marker to display info window that shows basic information about the selected museum.

The goal of this project was to develop a single page application (in React.js) featuring a map of some neighborhood with extra functionality added to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### Requirements to finish the project

- Write code required to display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within this neighborhood. Your app should display those locations by default when the page is loaded.
- Implement a list view of the set of locations.
- Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. The list view and the markers should update accordingly in real time. 
- Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked (ex: Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc).

## Instruction

1. Download the repository and save it on your computer
2. From inside the new directory, install dependencies with `npm install` (you will need Node.js and npm already installed on your machine).
Project was bootstrapped with Create React App, so all dependencies will be automatically installed.
3. Use command line `npm start` to run the application in you browser (the server will automatically run on port 3000).
4. In order to cache and make the app available offline you need to run the production build. Use command line: `npm run serve`, `serve -s build` and then navigate to http://localhost:5000/.

### Important
Most of the code used for developing this application was taken from Udacity lessons. Other resources used: Google Maps API documentation, Foursquare documentation, Stack Overflow as well as analized other students problems posted on Slack and Udacity forums.
